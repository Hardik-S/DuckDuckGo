# DuckDuckGo

![Beautiful Ducks](https://github.com/Hardik-S/DuckDuckGo/blob/master/_project-1-1.png)

Machine Learning Algorithm to differentiate between data set containing Mallards, Domestic Ducks, and Rubber Duckies. Useful for determining whether or not to squish a cute ducky. 

Utilizes similar concepts to 3 & 7 program with image recognition. Utilizes widgets produced by Jeremy Howard's team. 

To use yourself, please upload the .txt files containing duck URLs to colab/ jupyter and drag to a folder named ducks. The program automatically creates it the first run through if you forget. Should achieve ~90% accuracy following second round of fitting.
